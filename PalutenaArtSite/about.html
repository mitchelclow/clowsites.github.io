<div class="standardDiv"><p>My name is Mitchel Clow, and I am a player on the SUNY HVCC NJCAAE Super Smash Bros. Ultimate eSports team.
	<br><br>
	I competed in both the Fall of 2020 and Spring of 2021, and was able to place in the top 30 in the Nation both seasons.<br><br>
	I am a CISS Major at HVCC, and recently earned my first HVCC Associates in Digtial Media, which gave me my love for photography in digital spaces.<br><br>
	I am eager to continue my eSports gameplay and video game photography at SUNY Poly Utica when I attend there Fall 2021.
